This reference manual details functions, modules, and objects
included in moderndid, describing what they are and what they do.

.. _did-module:

DiD with Multiple Time Periods
==============================

The ``moderndid.did`` module implements difference-in-differences estimators for
multiple time periods and staggered treatment adoption following
`Callaway and Sant'Anna (2020) <https://psantanna.com/files/Callaway_SantAnna_2020.pdf>`_.
This module provides tools for estimating group-time average treatment effects and
aggregating them into summary treatment effect parameters.

.. _drdid-module:

Doubly Robust DiD
=================

The ``moderndid.drdid`` module contains a comprehensive suite of doubly robust
difference-in-differences estimators based on `Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020)
<https://psantanna.com/files/SantAnna_Zhao_DRDID.pdf>`_. These estimators combine
outcome regression and propensity score methods to provide improved local efficiency
and robustness to model mis-specification for both panel data and repeated cross-sections.

.. _didhonest-module:

Sensitivity Analysis and Honest DiD
====================================

The ``moderndid.didhonest`` module implements sensitivity analysis for difference-in-differences
following `Rambachan and Roth (2023) <https://asheshrambachan.github.io/assets/files/hpt-draft.pdf>`_.
It provides tools for conducting inference that is robust to violations of parallel trends
assumptions, including bounds under various restrictions on post-treatment bias.

.. _bootstrap-module:

Bootstrap Methods
=================

The ``moderndid.bootstrap`` module provides comprehensive bootstrap inference methods
for all DiD estimators. These include weighted bootstrap for panel and repeated
cross-section data, as well as multiplier bootstrap methods and semiparametric
influence functions.

.. _propensity-module:

Propensity Score Methods
========================

The ``moderndid.propensity`` module implements propensity score estimation and
weighting methods used across various DiD estimators. This includes IPW (inverse
probability weighting), IPT (inverse probability tilting), and AIPW (augmented IPW) methods.

   The following modules are currently under development and not yet available for use.
   They are included here to show the planned scope of the moderndid package.

.. _didcont-module:

Continuous Treatment DiD
========================

The ``moderndid.didcont`` module extends difference-in-differences methods to
settings with continuous treatment variables following `Callaway et al. (2024)
<https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.02637>`_, allowing for dose-response analysis
in causal inference with panel data.

.. _didinter-module:

Intertemporal DiD
=================

The ``moderndid.didinter`` module provides methods for difference-in-differences
analysis following `Chaisemartin & D'Haultf≈ìuille (2024) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04267>`_,
focusing on intertemporal effects where treatment may be non-binary and non-absorbing.

Machine Learning DiD
===================

The ``moderndid.didml`` module integrates machine learning methods with
difference-in-differences estimation following `Hatamyar et al. (2023)
<https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.11962>`_, providing tools for flexible model
specification and high-dimensional covariate adjustment.

.. _drdidweak-module:

Weak Doubly Robust DiD
======================

The ``moderndid.drdidweak`` module implements doubly robust estimators following
`Ma et al. (2023) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.08974>`_ that maintain good properties
even under weak overlap conditions or limited common support between treatment and control groups.

.. _didcomp-module:

Compositional DiD
=================

The ``moderndid.didcomp`` module addresses DiD setups with repeated cross-sectional
data and potential compositional changes across time periods following
`Sant'Anna & Xu (2025) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13925>`_.

.. _didlocal-module:

Local DiD Estimators
====================

The ``moderndid.didlocal`` module implements local projections DiD following
`Dube et al. (2025) <https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31184/w31184.pdf>`_
to address possible biases arising from negative weighting.

.. _did2s-module:

Two-Stage DiD
=============

The ``moderndid.did2s`` module implements two-stage difference-in-differences estimators
following `Gardner (2021) <https://jrgcmu.github.io/2sdd_current.pdf>`_. This approach
addresses issues with two-way fixed effects regressions in settings with staggered
treatment timing.

This tool decomposes two-way fixed effects DiD estimates into a weighted average of all possible 2x2
DiD comparisons.
