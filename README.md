__pyDiD__ is a Python package implementing a variety of DiD and doubly robust DiD estimators with potentially multiple time periods, staggered treatment adoption, and when parallel trends may only be plausible after conditioning on covariates.
<br><br><br>

We also implement an efficient estimator for settings with quasi-random treatment timing and a test for whether parallel trends is insensitive to functional form.
