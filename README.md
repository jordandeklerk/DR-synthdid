__DR-synthdid__ is a Python package implementing doubly robust causal inference that combines Difference-in-Differences with Synthetic Control methods, providing valid estimation under either parallel trends or synthetic control assumptions.
<br>

__DR-synthdid__ is an unofficial implementation of the paper [Difference-in-Differences Meets Synthetic Control: Doubly Robust Identification and Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11375).
